# PlasmaPhysics
Collection of Plasma physics maths for visualization help
I'm a recent graduate of physics who has a great deal of interest in Plasma physics and pursuing its study. 
This collection of files is intended to help me and others to vizualize some of the harder concepts in plasma
physics as well as model some specific situations. It may also include some basic mathematical files on ODEs or 
other related (or unrelated) topics. In the future, I will be willing to take help and contributions, but for now,
I am just beginning my collection.
